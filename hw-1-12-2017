Absolute vs Relative Paths
For Amanda, she could use options 5, 7, 8, and 9. 

Relative Path Resolution
Since the "ls../backup" script will display what is found in that file you would get #4: original, pnas_final, and pnas_sub.

ls Reading Comprehension
Since both 2 and 3 with display the correct reverse order, #4 is correct. 

Exlporing More ls Arguments
ls allows one to see a list. The -l shows information such as size and modification time while -h makes a file called "human readable" or something simpler for reading

Listing Recursively and By Time
Combining "ls-R -t" will provide the output of directories listed in alphabetical for each level and sorted by last edits within each directory
